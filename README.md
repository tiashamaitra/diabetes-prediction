Description: This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on certain diagnostic measures included in the dataset. We have implemented several machine learning algorithms for this classification task, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors classifier, support vector classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest.
Algorithms implemented :
Logistic Regression,
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier,
Support Vector Classifier (SVC),
Gaussian Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest
